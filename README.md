## Hi there 👋

I'm Chris from Greece, 23 years old, IT Applications Technician.

I design and build websites, applications or whatever idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

Can work with FrontEnd ( HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ) & On Applications can work with C++ , Java and Python.

My favorite tools are Figma & Visual Studio Code.

Beginner friendly, I want to expand my skills meet new challenges and most importantly learn.
